# Godot Arcade

Front-end app for publishing, browsing and playing HTML5 games. Currently only supports games made with Godot, and those that use GLSE2.

This was an idea that came to fruition during the Arweave 2023 Summer Hackathon and is now being developed further.

## Description

Allows users to browse, play and upload HTML5 games made in Godot. It uploads all game files with a manifest, and uses the manifest to grab all the files back when playing back the game in the browser.

While uploading a game it also allows you to optionally choose to add a license to the work.

## Planned Features

- Box Art Display Thumbnails for games in the browse gallery
- Update UI to be cleaner
- GLSE3 Ggame support and support for games that use SharedArrayBuffer
- Curation Contracts
- Token for playing games
