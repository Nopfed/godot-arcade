# Godot Arcade
Godot renderer built on arweave using ArweaveKit for the 2023 arweave community hackathon.


## Description
The idea is to get Godot games stored onto and runnable from Arweave in the browser.


I am still very new to arweave so will be utilizing ArweaveKit as a stepping stone to understand how to code with Arweave.

Possibly utilizing Kwil and/or ArDrive for storage purposes.
